# k40_z-axis
Z axis for the K40 laser. This project is for metric extruded aluminium tubes. (The others I could find were for imperial tubing)
The parts to print are stored at the stl folder. In addition the svg files in the root folder were cut out of acrylic. These files are for the motor holder and the belt tensioner. (The belt is tensioned by pulling the base of the motor backwards)
